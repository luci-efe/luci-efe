## 🚀 About Me

7th semester Computer Systems Engineering student at ITESO (graduating Dec 2026), passionate about cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, and scalable systems. After leading AI development teams, I discovered my true calling in hands-on engineering—building the systems that power innovation.

**Currently:** Information Security Analyst @ Eternal Data | Former AI Systems Developer and Former Technical Project Manager @ TendencIA

**What makes me different:** I combine deep technical skills with project management experience, specializing in **AI-augmented development workflows** using frameworks like OpenSpec and SpecKit for enhanced code quality and team collaboration.

## 🎯 AI-Augmented Development

I leverage advanced AI frameworks to maximize development efficiency and code quality:

### OpenSpec & SpecKit
- 📐 **Spec-driven development**: Define architecture and contracts before implementation
- 🤖 **AI collaboration**: Structured context for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
- 👥 **Team alignment**: Clear specifications reduce scope creep by 30%
- 🔍 **Code review**: Automated consistency checks using CodeRabbit

**Example**: ReparaYa's `/openspec/` folder contains complete architectural specs enabling seamless AI-assisted development across the entire team.
