🚀 About Me

I am a Computer Systems Engineering student (graduating Dec 2026) specializing in DevOps and Data Engineering.

My career path is unique: I spent time as a Technical Project Manager leading AI teams before realizing my true calling was in the trenches—building the systems myself.

The "Hybrid" Edge: I don't just deploy infrastructure; I understand why the business needs it. I combine rigorous engineering with the ability to manage stakeholders, document effectively (OpenSpec), and reduce scope creep.

Impact

InfoSec Analyst

Eternal Data

Conducting threat intel analysis & ransomware research for clients like Cinépolis.

Tech PM & AI Dev

TendencIA

Built production voicebots (500+ calls/mo) and reduced scope creep by 30% using OpenSpec.

🎯 The "Secret Sauce": OpenSpec

I am a strong advocate for AI-Augmented Development.
I use frameworks like OpenSpec to define architecture and contracts before implementation. This allows me to:

Provide structured context to AI tools (Claude, Copilot).

Ensure human-AI alignment on complex logic.

Drastically reduce refactoring time.
