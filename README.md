<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->

🚀 About Me

I am a Computer Systems Engineering student (graduating Dec 2026) specializing in DevOps and Data Engineering.

My career path is unique: I spent time as a Technical Project Manager leading AI teams before realizing my true calling was in the trenches—building the systems myself.

The "Hybrid" Edge: I don't just deploy infrastructure; I understand why the business needs it. I combine rigorous engineering with the ability to manage stakeholders, document effectively (OpenSpec), and reduce scope creep.

<h3>🎯 The "Secret Sauce": OpenSpec</h3>
<p>I advocate for <b>AI-Augmented Development</b>. Defining architecture before coding allows me to align AI tools (Claude/Copilot) with human logic.</p>
